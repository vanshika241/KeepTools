KeepTools is a modern web application built to provide quick access to important online tools such as PDF converters, image compressors, design platforms, and OCR utilities.  
The platform offers a clean, card-based interface, making it easy for users to navigate and use multiple tools efficiently.  

This project is developed using **Java and JSP** for the backend and **HTML/CSS** for the frontend. The background effect is created using the **PatternCraft** tool to give a visually appealing experience.
